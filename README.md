# Artistic Style Robotic Painting
by: Ardavan Bidgoli, Manuel Rodriguez Ladr√≥n de  Guevara, Cinnie Hsiung, Jean Oh, Eunsu Kang  
A research project on applying artistic style for robotic painting. The project is under development in two branches:

1. Applying Artistic Style 
  - [x] Playback: Colelcting user's brushstrokes and reproduce them on a robot.
  - [ ] Generation: Generating new brushstrokes based on the collected data:
      - [x] Bitmap representation of brushstrokes
      - [ ] Sequence of motions to reproduce the physical brushstroke
2. Painting using a robotic arm:
  - [x] Painting abstract images using robotic plain brushstrokes
  
* The ultimate goal is to combine the two branches:
  - [ ] Robotic painting using stylized brushstrokes.

## Publication
(will be added later)

## Structure
* The data set:
The data set contains +700 examples of brushstrokes demonstrated by a user. Each brushstroke is availabel as a pair, 1) the sequence of brush motions in space, 2) the scanned brushstoke as an image. 
**Brush motions** were collected using a motion capture system and a costum-made rigid-body marker. The coordinations were processed later, thus the center of coordination system is located at the center of each cell. Brushmotions are saved as numpy array.
**Brtushstrokes** are scanned and converted to fixed size images and saved as a numpy array.
