**Artistic Style in Robotic Painting: a Machine Learning Approach to Learning Brushstroke from Human Artists**


Robotic painting has been a subject of interest among both artists and roboticists since the 1970s. Researchers and interdisciplinary artists have employed various painting techniques and human-robot collaboration models to create visual mediums on canvas. One of the challenges of robotic painting is to apply a desired artistic style to the painting. Style transfer techniques with machine learning models have helped us address this challenge with the visual style of a specific painting. However, other manual elements of style, i.e., painting techniques and brushstrokes of an artist have not been fully addressed. We propose a method to integrate an artistic style to the brushstrokes and the painting process through collaboration with a human artist. In this paper, we describe our approach to 1) collect brushstrokes and hand-brush motion samples from an artist, and 2) train a generative model to generate brushstrokes that pertains to the artist's style, and 3) integrate the learned model on a robot arm to paint on a canvas. In a preliminary study, 71% of human evaluators find our robot's paintings pertaining to the characteristics of the artist's style.

This project aims to develop a method to integrate an artistic style to the brushstrokes and the painting process through collaboration with a human artist. In this paper, we describe our approach to 1) collect brushstrokes and hand-brush motion samples from an artist, and 2) train a generative model to generate brushstrokes that pertains to the artist's style, and 3) integrate the learned model on a robot arm to paint on a canvas.

## Status

The project is under development in two branches:

1. Applying Artistic Style
   - [x] Playback: Colelcting user's brushstrokes and reproduce them on a robot.
   - [ ] Generation: Generating new brushstrokes based on the collected data:
      - [x] Bitmap representation of brushstrokes
      - [ ] Sequence of motions to reproduce the physical brushstroke
2. Painting using a robotic arm:
    - [x] Painting abstract images using robotic plain brushstrokes

- The ultimate goal is to combine the two branches:
  - [ ] Robotic painting using stylized brushstrokes.

# Dataset

The dataset contains +700 examples of brushstrokes demonstrated by a user. Each brushstroke is availabel as a pair, 1) the sequence of brush motions in space, 2) the scanned brushstoke as an image. Use [this notebook](./Notebooks/Motion_and_image_processing_visualizations.ipynb) to process and review data.
<!-- ![Data collection](./media/data_collection.png) -->

**Brush motions** were collected using a motion capture system and a costum-made rigid-body marker. The coordinations were processed later, thus the center of coordination system is located at the center of each cell. Brushmotions are saved as numpy array.

# Tests

We set up a series of tests to investigate our approach:

**Robotic setup**

We use an ABB IRB 120 articulated robotic arm with 6 degree of freedom. The inverse kinematics as well as controlling the torque on each joint is moderated by the ABB drivers. We feed the robot with a sequence of target poses.

**Robotic replay**: In this test, the robotic arm replays the exact sequence of poses demonstrated by the users. The results were closely similar to the samples created by the user.

  <img width="40%"  src="./media/brushes_survey.png">
  <p style="font-size:12px"> Robotic arm replaying recorded brushstrokes, survey results indicated that users cannot meaningfully recognize the hand-drawn brushstrokes from the robotically-drawn ones.</p>
</div>

**Robotic painting**: In this test, we use learning to paint model and rendered a given image into a sequence of brushstrokes then executed them on our robot. We used [LearningToPaint](https://github.com/megvii-research/ICCV2019-LearningToPaint) to convert a given image into a series of brushstrokes and then program the robot to run them. LearningToPaint outputs were in the format of quadrative curve parameters. We processed these curves in [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/) plug-in for [Rhinocoros](https://www.rhino3d.com/) modeling package and converted them into a series of targets in space. These targets were converted into RAPID code, ABB's proprietary programming language, using [HAL](http://hal-robotics.com/) add-on.

### Generating new samples

We used a VAE to generate new samples of brushstrokes. The animation below demonstrates the navigation over three latent vectos of a tested VAE:

[WIP]
We also compared different architectures for the VAE to evaluate their performance (different from the model that generated the above gif):
| Model | Epochs | Batch size | Hidden dim. | - ELBO | Recon Loss | KL Loss |
|-------|--------|------------|------------------|------|------------|---------|
|**MLP**|250|32|32|54.3172|44.3513| 9.9658|
|**CNN**|250|32|32|62.9060| 52.7050| 10.2009|
