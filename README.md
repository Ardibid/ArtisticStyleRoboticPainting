The project is under development in two branches:

1. Applying Artistic Style
   - [x] Playback: Colelcting user's brushstrokes and reproduce them on a robot.
   - [ ] Generation: Generating new brushstrokes based on the collected data:
      - [x] Bitmap representation of brushstrokes
      - [ ] Sequence of motions to reproduce the physical brushstroke
2. Painting using a robotic arm:
    - [x] Painting abstract images using robotic plain brushstrokes

* The ultimate goal is to combine the two branches:
  - [ ] Robotic painting using stylized brushstrokes.

## Publication

## Structure

The repo is organized in two sectoins: 1) data set, 2) ML models, 3) robotic control process.

### The data set:

The data set contains +700 examples of brushstrokes demonstrated by a user. Each brushstroke is availabel as a pair, 1) the sequence of brush motions in space, 2) the scanned brushstoke as an image.

**Brush motions** were collected using a motion capture system and a costum-made rigid-body marker. The coordinations were processed later, thus the center of coordination system is located at the center of each cell. Brushmotions are saved as numpy array.

**Brtushstrokes** are scanned and converted to fixed size images and saved as a numpy array.

# Tests

## Robotic setup

We use an ABB IRB 120 articulated robotic arm with 6 degree of freedom. The inverse kinematics as well as controlling the torque on each joint is moderated by the ABB drivers. We feed the robot with a sequence of target poses.

## Generating new samples

We used a VAE to generate new samples of brushstrokes.
